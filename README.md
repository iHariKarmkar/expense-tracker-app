# This is an Expense Tracker web app built using React.js

This project is created while learning React.js. This is very basic web app which does not use any database.


## Features which I will add in the future
- I will connect it to a database
- Login SignUp functionality so that user can create their profile and add their expenses. User can add and view expenses only to their account. No one can see others expenses and obviously no one can add into another account.
